## Permissions and Ownership Commands

`ls -l`  
Lists files in long format, showing detailed file permissions (rwx), number of links, owner, group, size, and timestamp.

`ls -ld <directory>`  
Displays permissions and ownership for a directory itself (without listing its contents).

`chmod <permissions> <file>`  
Changes file permissions using numeric (e.g., `755`) or symbolic modes (e.g., `u+rwx,g+rx,o+rx`).

`chmod 755 <file>`  
Grants the owner full permissions and gives read/execute permissions to group and others.

`chmod -R 644 <directory>`  
Applies read/write permissions to files recursively within a directory; subdirectories remain accessible.

`chgrp <group> <file>`  
Changes the group ownership of a file or directory without modifying the user ownership.

`whoami`  
Shows the currently logged-in username — useful for confirming user context before running privileged operations.

`id`  
Displays user identity and group memberships, including UID, GID, and secondary groups.

`groups`  
Lists all groups that the current or specified user belongs to.

`sudo`  
Executes a command with superuser privileges, enabling permission or ownership changes that require root access.

`su - <user>`  
Switches to another user account (with their environment variables and shell context).

`passwd <user>`  
Sets or changes the password for a specified user account.

## Permission Value Breakdown

4 (r) + 2 (w) + 1 (x) = 7 (rwx)  ← Full permissions

4 (r) + 2 (w) + 0     = 6 (rw-)  ← Read + Write

4 (r) + 0     + 1 (x) = 5 (r-x)  ← Read + Execute  

0     + 2 (w) + 1 (x) = 3 (-wx)  ← Write + Execute

4 (r) + 0     + 0     = 4 (r--)  ← Read only

0     + 2 (w) + 0     = 2 (-w-)  ← Write only

0     + 0     + 1 (x) = 1 (--x)  ← Execute only

0     + 0     + 0     = 0 (---)  ← No permissions
